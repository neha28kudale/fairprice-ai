# Project: FairPrice AI

## Problem Statement
India’s Public Distribution System (PDS) suffers from:
- Fake ration entries
- Denial of grains
- Overcharging
- Stock diversion

Beneficiaries often don’t know their entitlements or when fraud occurs.

## Proposed Solution
FairPrice AI is an AI-powered transparency system that:
- Verifies ration delivery using voice & OCR
- Detects shop-level fraud patterns
- Alerts officials automatically

## Target Users
- Ration beneficiaries
- Fair Price Shop owners
- District food officers
- State food departments

## Key Features
1. Voice-based ration verification (local languages)
2. OCR on ration receipts & registers
3. Fraud pattern detection using AI
4. SMS/WhatsApp alerts for beneficiaries
5. Admin fraud dashboard for officials

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Works offline-first
- Supports regional languages
- Tamper-resistant logs
- Secure citizen data

## Success Metrics
- Reduction in fake distributions
- Increased beneficiary trust
- Faster fraud detection
